      <h2>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER</h2>
       <p> There are 2 games. One game is called Kaidro: Clan Battles and is purely web2. It's a MOBA shooter that lives on steam. NFTs are used purely as skin within this game.
         The second game lives on the Kaidro.com website and is the web3 aspect of Kaidro. In this web3 game, You combine NFTs to 
         synergize and give points towards a monthly leaderboard. $KDR will be distributed in proportion to the number of points you
          accumulate in a month. There is also a spin wheel which will give you the chance to earn more points and get ahead, 
          and prevents the game from being too predictable. Other prizes (merch, NFTs, etc) can be won as well. Read about the details of KDR below.

      <h2> Step 1 </h2>
       <p> Create a steam account and download the game. Go to the steam store look for Kaidro: Clan battles. Download and wait for it to appear in the library.
        Log into the game. Create an in-game account. Remember your username and password as you will be logging this into the Kaidro website later on. (YES! this is an IMPORTANT
        step even if you don't plan on playing the steam game. You need the badge for this)

      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <p>Create an account in the Kaidro website. Now for this step you need to have a ronin wallet. I've placed a direct link to a tutorial how to create
        a ronin wallet below. Once you have a ronin wallet go to Kaidro.com. Click the "Free journal mint" at the buttom right of your screen. Follow the prompts and wait as minting may
      take some time. Once that's done you congratulations you are now part of the kaidro universe. </p>

      <h2>Step 3</h2>
      <p> Once the free journal is minted in the kaidro.com website you can start fulfilling your quests. 
        You will need to fulfill a minimum 14 quests (collect 14 badges) before you can participate in the $KDR distribution.
        You will also need to combine 3 NFTs of the same clan to synergize and produce points. If you combine the same color theme, and combine
         a pilot, spirit guardian and spark suit you will get bonuses. <br>
         <br>
         I have placed a link here to an automated calculator I created. You only
         need to choose from the dropdown in columns B to D - the NFT type, rarity and color - then it will compute your daily and weekly synergies for you. 
         It will even tell you the cost of setting it up! Make your plans of what NFT to buy before proceeding to step 4.

      <h2>Step 4</h2>
      <p> Once you've decided what to buy head over to the MAVIS MARKET. I placed a link that will take you directly to the different NFT collections. Once in the mavis market you can use
        the filter to look for traits that you want your NFTs to have. For synergy, COLOR THEME is the trait that gives a bonus. All 3 NFTs must have the same color theme. The higher the TIER the higher the base points. 
       Refer back to the synergy calculator in step 3 if you need guidance. Once you buy all NFTs, head over to Kaidro.com and set up your synergies in the synergy page </p>
