      <h2>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER</h2>
       <p> There are 2 games. One game is called Kaidro: Clan Battles and is purely web2. It's a MOBA shooter that lives on steam. NFTs are used purely as skin within this game.
         The second game lives on the Kaidro.com website and is the web3 aspect of Kaidro. In this web3 game, You combine NFTs to 
         synergize and give points towards a monthly leaderboard. $KDR will be distributed in proportion to the number of points you
          accumulate in a month and the number of people who participate (very similar to axie's play to rice system). There is also a spin wheel which will give you the chance to earn more points and get ahead, 
          and prevents the game from being too predictable. Other prizes (merch, NFTs, etc) can be won as well. Read about the details of KDR below.

      <h2>Step 3: Collect badges and plan what NFT you will buy </h2>
      <ul> 
        <li> Once the free journal is minted in the kaidro.com website you can start fulfilling your quests.</li> 
        <li> Fulfill a minimum 14 quests (collect 14 badges, required*) .</li>
        <li> You need to combine 3 NFTs of the same clan to synergize and produce points. You get bonuses by matching themes and
          by combining different NFT types</li>
        <li> Visit the automated calculator I created. With it, you can combine different NFTs to see how much points you will produce.
          Create a copy of the calculator and plan what NFTs you need before buying. You only need to choose from the dropdown in columns B to D - the NFT type, rarity and color.</li>

          You will also be given 1 Kalodium for every 5 synergy points you create, which will also be given on Saturday. You can use the Kalodium
          to spin in the spinwheel and increase your leaderboard rankings. Join can the Kaidro discord community to stay up to date with the latest events in the kaidro community. You can also ask questions there if you feel that any of this is too difficult.
