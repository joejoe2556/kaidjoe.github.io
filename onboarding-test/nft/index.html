      <h2>IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER</h2>
       <p> There are 2 games. One game is called Kaidro: Clan Battles and is purely web2. It's a MOBA shooter that lives on steam. NFTs are used purely as skin within this game.
         The second game lives on the Kaidro.com website and is the web3 aspect of Kaidro. In this web3 game, You combine NFTs to 
         synergize and give points towards a monthly leaderboard. $KDR will be distributed in proportion to the number of points you
          accumulate in a month. There is also a spin wheel which will give you the chance to earn more points and get ahead, 
          and prevents the game from being too predictable. Othe prizes can be won as well. The web2 game has minimal effect on the web3 
          game, and this is thru badges. Game badges give rank points depending on their tier.

      <h2>Step 2</h2>
      <p>Create an account in the Kaidro website. Now for this step you need to have a ronin wallet. I've placed a direct link to a tutorial how to create
        a ronin wallet below. Once you have a ronin wallet go to Kaidro.com. Click the "Free journal mint" at the buttom right of your screen. Follow the prompts and wait as minting may
      take some time. Once that's done you congratulations you are now part of the kaidro universe. </p>
