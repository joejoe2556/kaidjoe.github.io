      <h2> What is Kaidro? </h2>
      <img src="images/kaidro.png" alt="Kaidro">
      <p><em>Kaidro: The Awakening</em> is a one-of-a-kind intellectual property that encompasses three components: a comic, a game, and an animated series. Together, these elements offer consumers a fully immersive experience within an ever-expanding universe. The lore is set in the post-apocalyptic yet stunning world of T'aljor, a realm shrouded in ancient magic and technological wonders. In this world, Gaia is the revered deity, and there are two distinct races: the Trakarians and the K'ailantians. The K'ailantians are admired for their deep connection to the astral realm, granting them unparalleled abilities to manipulate the forces of the cosmos. They serve as guardians of ancient wisdom and custodians of spiritual balance within T'aljor. In contrast, the Trakarians have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge and technological innovation. Although they lack inherent magical abilities, the Trakarians compensate with advanced war machines and mech suits. Much of the conflict in this universe arises from the Trakarians driving the K'ailantians out and mining Kalodium, the world's most valuable resource.</p>

<p>Within the K'ailantian race, there exists a special lineage known as the Kaidros, which literally translates to "source bearer." These individuals can harness the raw power and energy of the astral realm, making them ten times more powerful than the average K'ailantian. The comic and animation follow the story of Ava, a young Kaidro, as she discovers her identity and her extraordinary powers. It's an engaging narrative that you can read now in full on Webtoons or at <a href="https://kaidro.com">kaidro.com</a>. If you are a 90s kid who grew up with classic mech series like *Gundam*, *Evangelion*, and *BTX*, then this IP is tailor-made for you.</p>

    <div class="section-content">
      <h2> The game </h2>
      <img src="images/game.png" alt="Game">
      <p>The game is a PvPvE isometric shooter that falls within the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre. You start as a team of three and battle two other teams for points. You earn points by killing opponents and other VOID entities. There's a big boss in the middle of the map, and taking him down awards significant points. There isn't a lot to say at this stage because we are still in the alpha phase, but I can tell you that it is incredibly fun and highly competitive. One aspect I particularly appreciate is that the game is free to play and not gated by NFTs. This means you can download and enjoy the game without owning an NFT. 
        The NFTs act purely as in-game skins, offering no advantage, extra stats, or anything of that sort.</p>

<p>I personally prefer it this way because nobody likes a pay-to-win game.
   When you look at the games that have thrived over the past decade, it's the free-to-play,
    skill-based games that have done the best.
     Take DOTA, Counter-Strike, or Valorant, for example—these games are massive, with million-dollar, community-funded prize pools,
      all because they are free to play and skill-based.
       Introduce a pay-to-win mechanic, and a game quickly dies. The fact that this game is built on Steam is a huge step for the web3 community, as it opens up opportunities to onboard more web2 users into the space. Kaidro is leading the way.</p>

<p>It was leaked to us that the game will also feature a PvE mode, much like *Diablo*, where you can have wholesome fun with friends, going on missions together in a casual, non-competitive way. What's unique about it is that the events, activities, and quests in the game will also be part of the lore. The game is called Clan Battles precisely because there are four clans within T’aljor: Grimbone, Bubblegum Violence, Emerald Hand, and Free Wrist Clan. Owning a Sparksuit from a clan has now become a way for you to participate in the lore. Find out which clan you belong to by taking our personality quiz!</p>

      <h2> The NFT collection </h2>
      <img src="images/nft.png" alt="NFT">
      
      <p>If you are new to NFTs, I suggest watching the video linked below. I understand that learning something new can be intimidating, but NFTs are a beautiful innovation. Imagine the reaction of people when they first encountered televisions. It scared a lot of them initially, but eventually, it was accepted worldwide. The same can be said for NFTs. Take the time to understand them, and you'll see they aren't so daunting after all.</p>

      <p>Returning to Kaidro, there are currently four NFTs available: The Journal, Sparksuits, Spirit Guardians, and Pilots. The Journal can be minted for free. It’s designed to be a low-cost, basic entry point to the entire IP. By minting it, you gain access to the website, where you can read the entire comic series, participate in events, and interact with the entire intellectual property (IP). It's like their very own version of Xbox Live.</p>
      
      <p>Paid NFTs (Sparksuits, Spirit Guardians, and Pilots) offer premium access to the entire IP. They provide benefits such as airdrops of future NFTs and early access to everything Kaidro-related. Currently, there are 9,999 Sparksuits and 15,000 Spirit Guardians. The number of Pilots will be fewer. Click the buttons provided to view these collections. Each NFT has a set of traits that combine to create truly unique assets. In terms of utility, certain combinations of NFTs will earn you points. You will receive $KDR tokens in proportion to your points within a ranked leaderboard system. If you want to earn $KDR, follow the steps by clicking the button below.</p>

    <div class="section-content">
      <h2> Tokenomics </h2>
      <img src="images/kdr.jpg" alt="Tokenomics">
      <p>There are currently two tokens in the Kaidro ecosystem: $KDR and $Kalodium. $KDR is the primary, tradeable token, scheduled for release in September 2024. It will play a key role in the minting of the third NFT, the Pilots, and will also be used to purchase synergy slots, allowing participation in the Synergy system to earn more $KDR.</p>

      <p>The whitepaper provides insight into the Kaidro token, stating: "The Kaidro token, $KDR, will serve and be used in the Kaidro universe ecosystem. The future uses for the $KDR token will include, but not be limited to, the purchase of Synergy lock-ups for the Kaidro NFTs, special orders of physical merchandise, Kaidro NFTs, Battle Passes, unlocking special gear in-game, and more to be disclosed. The exact date for the Token Generation Event (TGE) has not yet been announced." The team is focused on ensuring $KDR is used extensively throughout the ecosystem. Their design incentivizes spending $KDR on the website, rewarding users elsewhere within the IP.</p>
      
      <p>A fixed amount of $KDR will be airdropped to NFT holders (Sparksuits, Spirit Guardians, and Collectible Journals). The majority of $KDR will be distributed monthly based on leaderboard placements. To earn rank points on the leaderboard, players must participate in the web3 game available on the kaidro.com website. For details about the web3 game, click the "Read about Synergy here" button below.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Opinion:</strong> Kaidro diverges from the grind-heavy culture typical of most web3 games, opting instead to reward users simply for holding their NFTs. While setting weekly synergies is required, it demands minimal effort. You don't need to grind or play the Steam game to benefit. I also appreciate that $KDR is gated at 150 rank points, making it difficult for non-human users to achieve, as actively acquiring badges and getting lucky on the spinwheel are necessary to reach the 150-point threshold.</p>
