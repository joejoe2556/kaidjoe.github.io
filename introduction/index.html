      <h2> What is Kaidro? </h2>
      <img src="images/kaidro.png" alt="Kaidro">
      <p> Kaidro the awakening is a one of a kind intellectual property
        that has three components - a comic, a game and an animated series. All these are meant to take its consumers on a fully immersive experience across an ever-expanding universe. The lore is set on the post-apocalyptic yet beautiful world of T'aljor. It is shrouded 
        in the mists of ancient magic and technological wonders. In this world, Gaia is the deity and there are two races. The Trakarians and K'ailantians. The K'ailantians are revered for their innate connection to the astral realm granting them unparalleled abilities to 
        manipulate the forces of the cosmos. They are like guardians of ancient wisdom and custodians of  spiritual balance within T'aljor. In contrast, the Trakarians have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge and technological innovation.
        They themselves do not have inherent magical abilities. Trakarians compensate with war machines and mech suits. We know that a lot of conflict arises from the Trakarians driving the K'ailantians out and mining 
        Kalodium  the world resource. <p>

        <p>There exists a special lineage of K'ailantians known as the Kaidros. It translates literally to source bearer. One who can harness the raw power and energy of the astral realm. 
        They are 10x more powerful than the average K'ailantian. In the comics and animation We follow the story of Ava a young kaidro as she discovers her identity and her powers. 
        It’s a fun story. You can read it now completely on webtoons or in the kaidro.com website. If you are one of the 90s kids who grew up with the old school mechs - Gundam and evangelion, BTX - then this IP is for you. </p>

      <h2> Who are the developers? </h2>
      <img src="images/devs.jpg" alt="Developers">
      <p>It all started with Peggy Chung and Robert Simons. They hail from the Art Center College of Design,
         one of the best graphic design schools in the US. Robert continued his work in cinema with director Michael Bay on 
         <em>Transformers</em>. Peggy worked with Guillermo Del Toro on <em>Pacific Rim</em>. 
         They realized that there was a demand for top-tier designers in the field, so they established Gadget-Bot 
         Productions in 2011.</p>

      <p>Since then, they have been engaged in character concept art, environment concept art, 
        esports weapons concept art, 3D game assets (characters and weapons), film production and development, 
        game development, and animation production and development. They’ve worked on 
        big titles in the gaming industry, 
        including AAA games like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Borderlands</em>, as well as major movie
         titles. These professionals are not only experts in graphic design, but they are also skilled storytellers,
          which is why I’m personally bullish about this project.</p>
      
      <p>I believe they are the most qualified to create NFTs in this space precisely because they can easily
         craft experiences that people can enjoy. Access to experiences is what gives NFTs utility and value. 
         The team's ability to create immersive experiences is what will keep the economy alive and prevent people 
         from cashing out the token every time they extract it from the IP. Sustainability is achieved when people 
         stop exchanging your token for cash and start spending it on the IP to immerse themselves further. 
         The past few months have been amazing for me as a Sparksuit holder. 
         I was airdropped the second NFT—Spirit Guardian—for free. I have early access to everything related
          to <em>Kaidro</em>, including the game and the animated series. The team has been shipping non-stop.

      <h2> The game </h2>
      <img src="images/game.png" alt="Game">
      <p>The game is a PvPvE isometric shooter that falls within the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre. You start as a team of three and battle two other teams for points. You earn points by killing opponents and other VOID entities. There's a big boss in the middle of the map, and taking him down awards significant points. There isn't a lot to say at this stage because we are still in the alpha phase, but I can tell you that it is incredibly fun and highly competitive. One aspect I particularly appreciate is that the game is free to play and not gated by NFTs. This means you can download and enjoy the game without owning an NFT. 
        The NFTs act purely as in-game skins, offering no advantage, extra stats, or anything of that sort.</p>

<p>I personally prefer it this way because nobody likes a pay-to-win game.
   When you look at the games that have thrived over the past decade, it's the free-to-play,
    skill-based games that have done the best.
     Take DOTA, Counter-Strike, or Valorant, for example—these games are massive, with million-dollar, community-funded prize pools,
      all because they are free to play and skill-based.
       Introduce a pay-to-win mechanic, and a game quickly dies. The fact that this game is built on Steam is a huge step for the web3 community, as it opens up opportunities to onboard more web2 users into the space. Kaidro is leading the way.</p>

<p>It was leaked to us that the game will also feature a PvE mode, much like *Diablo*, where you can have wholesome fun with friends, going on missions together in a casual, non-competitive way. What's unique about it is that the events, activities, and quests in the game will also be part of the lore. The game is called Clan Battles precisely because there are four clans within T’aljor: Grimbone, Bubblegum Violence, Emerald Hand, and Free Wrist Clan. Owning a Sparksuit from a clan has now become a way for you to participate in the lore. Find out which clan you belong to by taking our personality quiz!</p>

      <h2> The NFT collection </h2>
      <img src="images/nft.png" alt="NFT">
      <p>If you are new to NFTs then I suggest watching the video link below. I understand it may be scary learning something new, but NFTs are a beautiful thing. Imagine people who saw TVs for the first time.
         It scared a lot of people at the beginning but it eventually was accepted by the world, same thing goes for NFTs. Try understanding it and you will see it's not so bad after all.<p>
      <p> 
        Going back to Kaidro, there are currently 4 NFTs - The journal, sparksuits, spirit guardians, and pilots. The journal you can mint for free. 
        It’s meant to be a low cost, basic entry  point to the entire IP. You mint it. You enter the website. There you can read the entire comics
        participate in events and interact with the entire intellectual property (IP). It's like their very own version of Xbox live.
        <p>
          <p>Paid NFTs (Sparksuits, spirit guardians and Pilots) act as premium access to the entire IP. It will give you access to airdrops of future 
          NFTs. Early access to everything Kaidro. Currently there are 9,999 Sparksuits and 15,000 Spirit guardians. We know that the Pilots will be less. 
          Click the buttons provided to see these collections. Each NFT has a set of traits that are combined to produce truly unique NFTs. 
        In terms of utility, NFTs when combined in a certain way will give you points. You will be given $KDR in proportion to your points
        in a ranked leaderboard system. If you want to earn $KDR follow the steps when you click the button below.</p>

      <h2> Tokenomics </h2>
      <img src="images/kdr.jpg" alt="Tokenomics">
      <p> There are currently 2 tokens. $KDR and $Kalodium. $KDR is the main, tradeable token. It's set to release in September 2024.
         We know that it will play a part in the mint of the third NFT, the Pilots. It will also be used to buy synergy slots 
        to partipate in system that will make you earn more $KDR - Synergy.</p>
      
      <p> The whitepaper states this about the Kaidro token "The Kaidro token, $KDR, will serve and be used in the Kaidro 
        universe ecosystem. The future uses for the $KDR token will be but not limited to the purchase of Synergy
         lock ups for the Kaidro NFTs, special orders of physical merch, Kaidro NFTs, Battle Passes, unlocking special gear
          in-game and more to be disclosed. TGE exact date has not been announced yet." 
          The team wants $KDR to be used as much as possible. They are designing it so if you spend 
         your $KDR on the website you get rewarded elsewhere in the IP. </p> 
        <p>
          A fixed amount of $KDR will be airdropped to NFT holders (sparksuits, spirit guardians, collectible journals). 
          Majority of the $KDR will be distributed monthly based on leaderboard placements. To get rank points in the leaderboard 
          you have to play the web3 game on the kaidro.com website. To know the details of the web3 game click the button "read about synergy here" below.
        <p>OPINION: Kaidro stays away from most web3 game's grind culture and simply rewards you for holding their NFTs. 
          Of course they do require you to set synergies per week but that only requires minimal effort. You don't need to grind 
          or play the steam game. I also like that $KDR is gated at 150 rank points. It is hard for non-human users to achieve this as you need to 
          actively acquire badges and be lucky in the spinwheel to fulfill the 150 points.</p>
