      <p> Kaidro the awakening is a one of a kind intellectual property
        That has three components - a comic, a game and an animated series. All these are meant to take its consumers on a fully immersive experience across an ever-expanding universe. The lore is set on the post-apocalyptic yet beautiful world of T'aljor. It is shrouded in the mists of ancient magic
        and technological wonders. In this world, Gaia is the deity and there are two races. The Trakarians and K'ailantians. The K'ailantians are revered for their innate connection to astral powers, them unparalleled abilities to manipulate the forces of the cosmos.
        They are like guardians of ancient wisdom and custodians of  spiritual balance within T'aljor. In contrast, the Trakarians have dedicated themselves to the pursuit of knowledge and technological innovation.
        They themselves do not have inherent magical abilities. Trakarians compensate with war machines and mech suits. We know that a lot of conflict arises from the Trakarians driving the K'ailantians out and mining 
        Kalodium  the world resource. There exists a special lineage of K'ailantians known as the Kaidros. It translates literally to source bearer. One who can harness the raw power and energy of the astral realm. 
        They are 10x more powerful than the average K'ailantian. In the comics and animation We follow the story of Ava a young kaidro as she discovers her identity and her powers. 
        It’s a fun story. You can read it now completely on webtoons or in the kaidro.com website.</p>

      <p>It all started with Peggy Chung and Robert Simons. They hail from the Art Center College of Design, it is one the best graphic designs schools in the US. 
        Robert continued his work in cinema working with director Michael Bay on Transformers. Peggy worked with Guillermo Del Toro on “Pacific Rim”. They realized that there was a demand 
        for top-tier designers in the field so they established Gadgetbot productions in 2011. Since then they have been doing character concept art, Environment concept art
        Esports weapons concept art, 3D Game assets - characters and weapons, Films production and development, Games development, Animation production and development
        They’ve worked with big titles in the gaming industry. And these are just some of the projects they’ve worked on Call of duty, Apex Legends, Borderlands
        The list goes on and on. These guys are not only professionals in the field of graphic design but they are also professional storytellers and that's what
        makes me bullish about this project. Trust me I think they are the most qualified to create NFTs in this space. Access to experiences is what gives 
        NFT utility and value. Their ability to create quality experiences is what will keep the economy alive and would prevent people from
        cashing out the token every time they extract it from the IP. The team has taken us on a wild journey. Giving us airdrops, early access
        to comic, the game and the animated series. They've been shipping non-stop. (reference for the picture https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L6hs5tPD3k)

      <p> The game is a PvPvE isometric shooter that is a multiplayer online battle arena.
        You start as a team of 3 and battle 2 other teams for points.
        You get points by killing each other and other VOID entities. There is a big
        boss in the middle and  killing him gives significant points. There’s not a lot to say as of now because we are still in the alpha phase. But what I can say is that it is really fun 
        It's really and competitive. I also like That the game is free to play. It's not gated by the NFT meaning you can download it 
        and play even without having an NFT. The NFT acts purely as a skin in-game. It does not give any advantage, extra stats or anything like that. <p>
        <p>
        I personally prefer it to be that way, because nobody likes a pay to win game. When you look at games that have done so well over
        the past decade it’s the games that are free to play games that are skill-based. I mean look atDOTA, Counter-Strike or Valorant these games are massive with 
        million dollar, community-funded, prize pools, all because these are free-to-play and skill-based. Make a game pay to win and it dies. This is a huge step for the web3 community in order to 
        onboard more web2 users into the space and Kaidro is leading the way. <p>

        <p>It was leaked to us that the game will also have a PVE mode very much like diablo  
        where you just have wholesome fun with friends going on missions together in a casual, non-competitive way.
        What's unique about it is that the events/activities quests in game will also be part of the lore. It is called clan battles precisely because
        there are four clans within T’aljor Grimbone, Bubblegum violence Emerald hand, and Free wrist clan. Owning a sparksuit of a clan has now become a way for you to participate
        in the lore. Know which clan you belong to by taking our personality quiz! </p>

      <p>There are currently 4 NFTs. The journal, sparksuits, spirit guardians, and pilots. The journal you can mint for free. 
        It’s meant to be a low cost, basic entry  point to the entire IP. You mint it. You enter the website. There you can read the entire comics
        participate in events and interact with the entire intellectual property (IP). It's like their very own xbox live
        <p>
          <p>Paid NFTs (Sparksuits, spirit guardians and Pilots) act as premium access to the entire IP. It will give you access to airdrops of future 
          whitelists. Early access to everything Kaidro. Currently there are 9,999 Sparksuits and 15,000 Spirit guardians. We know that the Pilots will be less. 
          Click the buttons provided to see these collections. Each NFT has a set of traits that are combined to produce truly unique NFTs. 
        In terms of utility, NFTs when combined in a certain way will give you points. You will be given $KDR in proportion to your points
        in a ranked leaderboard system. If you want to earn $KDR follow the steps when you click the button below.</p>

  <div class="section" id="tokenomics">
    <div class="section-content">
      <img src="images/kdr.jpg" alt="Tokenomics">
      <p> There are currently 2 tokens. $KDR and $Kalodium. $KDR is the main, tradeable token. It's set to release in September 2024. We know that it will play a part in the mint of the third NFT, the Pilots. It will also be used to buy synergy slots 
        to partipate in Synergy to be given $KDR. There are plans of future use-cases but we have to standby for more. A fixed amount will be airdropped to NFT holders (sparksuits, 
        spirit guardians, collectible journals and possibly Pilots).<p> 
        <p>
         Majority of the $KDR will be distributed monthly based on leaderboard placements. To get rank points in the leaderboard you have to play
         the web3 game on the kaidro.com website. You are required to finish 14 quests and hold NFTs to qualify. I would describe the web3 game as a semi-active form of staking. You combine 3 NFTs to form 1 Synergy. You can get bonuses by combining 
         the same color theme and by using variety of NFTs. You get rank points and $kalodium as a byproduct of synergy. You can have infinite number of synergy sets.
         As of this writing, 1 synergy set costs 1 RON and the cost diminshes 50% per synergy slot unlocked till you reach a cap of 0.1 Ronin.
         You only need to set your synergy once a week. An leadearboard placements will have a monthly snapshot. $KDR will then be distributed monthly. <p>
        <p> In addition to synergy, there is a spin wheel where you can spin at a chance for more rank points, as well as other prizes (kinda like moku).
         To boost your prizes at the spin wheel you can use an NFT as a cartridge. Specific traits will give you boosts in chances depending on what trait is featured that day. 
         $Kalodium can also be used to boost chances. $Kaldoium is a non-tradeable, ERC20 token, that will be used to boost the spinwheel to earn more points.  Join the Kaidro community discord to be updated with the latest news or check our latest updates page in the main menu.

        <p>OPINION: Kaidro stays away from most web3 game's grind culture and simply rewards you for holding their NFTs. Of course they do require you to set synergies per week
          but that only requires minimal effort. You don't need to grind or play the steam game. This repels people who want to play the game just to milk the IP of it's token.
          I also like that $KDR is heavily protected from BOTS. The quests require some effort to finish 
          an you need complete 14 quests before you can even participate in $KDR distribution. In addition, the bot needs to set their synergies.  </p>
