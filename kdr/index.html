      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p> Two ways by which you get $KDR. (1) Get KDR from a fixed airdrop to your NFTs (Sparksuits > Spirit Guardians > Collectible Journals) this will be sometime
        in August 2024. (2) Monthly distribution by Leaderboard placement that you acquire by playing the web3 game on Kaidro.com 
        There are currently 2 tokens. $KDR and $Kalodium. $KDR is the main, tradeable token. It's set to release in September 2024. We know that it will play a part in the mint of the third NFT, the Pilots. It will also be used to buy synergy slots 
        to partipate in the web3 game on Kaidro.com to be given more $KDR. If you want to know more about its use cases go to the introduction part of this webpage. Click the link 
        below. The second token Kalodium is a non-tradeable ERC20 token that will be used for the web3 game. </p>

      <h2> How does the web3 game work? </h2>
      <img src="images/synergy.png" alt="Mechanics Image" class="content-image">
      <p> I would describe the web3 game as a semi-active form of staking. Kaidro stays away from most web3 game's grind culture and simply rewards you 
        for holding their NFTs. Of course they do require you to "play" or set synergies once per week but that only requires minimal 
        effort. There is also a spin wheel that gives you a chance to win more rank points and prizes. You don't need to grind or play the steam game. This repels people who want to play the game just to milk the IP of 
        it's token. I also like that $KDR is heavily protected from BOTS. The quests require some effort to finish and you need
         complete 14 quests before you can even participate in $KDR distribution. In addition, it all requires effort to setup.  <p>
          <p> 
        The requirements are as follows: (1) complete 14 quests in the kaidro.com website (This is fairly easy to accomplish) (2) have at least 3 NFTs of the same clan. You will combine 3 NFTs and lock them up to produce synergy. 
        There are bonuses you get when you combine 3 of the same color and when you combine 2 to 3 different NFT types. Base rank points are determined by
        NFT tier/rarity, the higher the tier the higher the points. NFT parts are used in another mechanic that will boost your chances at prizes in the spin wheel. 
        I made a synergy calculator for you to easily plan your purchases and see what points your gonna make and how much your gonna spend on fees. See the link below.<p>
          <p>Synergy slots currently cost 1 $RON and diminishes 50% per additional slot unlocked. There is no limit to the number of
            Synergy slots you can have on 1 account. We know that RON will be replaced with $KDR once it is launched. <p>
        <p>2 things are produced when you engage in synergy (1) Rank points - that rack up towards monthly leaderboards (2) Kalodium - a non-tradeable token
        used to in the spin wheel system. You get 1 Kalodium per 5-10 rank points you make (don't worry it's in the calculator).4
         1 Kalodium is used per spin. Each spin will give you a chance to win different tiers of prizes, one of them being rank points. 
         This prevents the game from being too predictable. 
        Every month a snapshot will be taken and $KDR will be distributed in proportion to your accumulated rank points.

      <h2> Badges </h2>
      <img src="images/badges.png" alt="Badges Image" class="content-image">
      <p> The Kaidro clan battles is a fun MOBA game built on steam. $KDR will have some functionality within this gaming ecosystem but 
        playing the game itself is not required for $KDR distribution. However, earning game badges does add some rank points and will
         impact your leaderboard placement significantly. Other badges can also be earned by engaging with different parts
          of the intellectual property. You get badges by reading the comics, engaging in social media etc.

      <h2> Spin Wheel </h2>
      <img src="images/spinwheel.png" alt="Spin Wheel Image" class="content-image">
      <p> The Spin wheel is a gacha-like game that allows you to spin a wheel to get more rank points. 1 Kalodium will be
        used per spin. There are other prizes to be won there as well (merchandise, physical comic books, NFTs, whitelists and many more)
        . Prizes are tiered and access to these prizes increases with 
        rarity of NFT parts (NFT cartridge system). No free spins. Unlimited number of spins per day as long as you have Kalodium to 
        burn.

      <h2> NFT cartridge </h2>
      <p> Once a day, the website will choose one of the 54 NFT traits to be featured. If you have an NFT with that trait, you can 
        use it as a cartridge to boost your chances at getting legendary prizes. Clan parts provide the highest boost and will have significantly
        higher chances at getting legendary prizes, IF, clan parts are called upon by the Cartridge system.
