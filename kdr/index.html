      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <p> Two ways by which you get $KDR. (1) Get KDR from a fixed airdrop to your NFTs (Sparksuits > Spirit Guardians > Collectible Journals) this will be sometime
        in August 2024. (2) Monthly distribution by Leaderboard placement that you acquire by playing the web3 game on Kaidro.com. It follows Axie's play to
        rice model where distribution depends on how many participate in the "game" and how much points you accumulate. 
        There are currently 2 tokens. $KDR and $Kalodium. $KDR is the main, tradeable token. It's set to release in September 2024. We know that it will play a part in the mint of the third NFT, the Pilots. It will also be used to buy synergy slots 
        to partipate in the web3 game on Kaidro.com to be given more $KDR. If you want to know more about its use cases go to the introduction part of this webpage. Click the link 
        below. The second token Kalodium is a non-tradeable ERC20 token that will be used for the web3 game. </p>

      <h2> How does the web3 game work? </h2>
      <img src="images/synergy.jpg" alt="Mechanics Image" class="content-image">
      <p> I would describe the web3 game as a semi-active form of staking. Kaidro stays away from the usual web3 game grind culture and rewards you 
        for holding their NFTs. Of course they do require you to "play" or set synergies once per week. There is also a spin wheel that gives you a chance to win more rank points and prizes.
        You don't need to grind or play the steam game. There is an effort to gate the distribution from bots by requiring at least 150 points to partcipate in the distribution of KDR. Journal 
        holders (free to play) really need to participate to get a chance at some $KDR but bulk of the KDR will go to those who participate in synergy.   
        <p>
          <p> 
        The requirements for synergizing are as follows: (1) complete 14 quests in the kaidro.com website (This is fairly easy to accomplish) 
        (2) have at least 3 NFTs of the same clan. You will combine 3 NFTs and lock them up to produce synergy. 
        There are bonuses you get when you combine 3 of the same color and when you combine 2 to 3 different NFT types. Base rank points are determined by
        NFT tier/rarity, the higher the tier the higher the points. NFT parts are used in another mechanic that will boost your chances at prizes in the spin wheel. 
        I made a synergy calculator for you to easily plan your purchases and see what points you're gonna make as well as how much your gonna spend on fees. See the link below. 
        REMEMBER you have to lock your synergies every from Sunday 0:00 - 23:59 UTC. Missing this time period will result loss of points
        for that day. <p>
          
          <p>Synergy slots currently cost 1 $RON and diminishes 50% per additional slot unlocked. There is no limit to the number of
            Synergy slots you can have on 1 account. We know that RON will be replaced with $KDR once it is launched. <p>

        <p>2 things are produced when you engage in synergy (1) Rank points - that acccumulate towards monthly leaderboards AND (2) Kalodium, a non-tradeable,
        token used to in the spin wheel system. You get 1 Kalodium per 5 rank points you make (don't worry it's in the calculator) which will be
        dropped to your account every Saturday. 1 Kalodium is used per spin.
         Each spin will give you a chance to win different tiers of prizes, one of them being rank points. The spin wheel
          prevents the game from being too predictable and gives people of the same number of NFTs a sense of competition. 
        Every month a snapshot will be taken and $KDR will be distributed in proportion to your accumulated rank points and the number of people who 
        played that month.
        <p> We know that journal holders can participate in the KDR airdrop if they engage enough with the entire IP and accumulate
          at least 150 points. They will have 1 free Kalodium per day to spin the wheel. I predict that their share is minimal compared
          to NFT holders which will get the lion's share.

          <p>REMEMBER: Synergy points are integrated into the rank points and KALO is distributed on Saturday and may take several hours
            to complete integration. Make sure you sync our official google calendar below with yours so you won't miss it! </p>

      <h2> Tools </h2>
      <img src="images/tools.png" alt="Badges Image" class="content-image">
      <p> Several tools are available for you to achieve success. You can look at the synergy calculator I created so you can theory craft 
        and create your synergies. This helps you make better decisions in buying NFTs in the marketplace. </p>
        <p> A lot of things happen in the Ronin network and within Kaidro itself. No worries. We created a google calendar you can 
          sync to your calendar so you get updated in all the important dates including synergy reset times. NO need to worry about missing these.

      <h2> Badges </h2>
      <img src="images/badges.png" alt="Badges Image" class="content-image">
      <p> You gain badges by interacting with the entire IP. Each Badge has equivalent points that contribute to the leaderboards. These
        badges impact your leaderboard placement significantly. You get badges by reading the comics, engaging in social media etc. Even
         journal horders can accumulate enough points to participate in the leaderboard if they engage the IP enough and get badges.

      <h2> Spin Wheel </h2>
      <img src="images/spinwheel.png" alt="Spin Wheel Image" class="content-image">
      <p> The Spin wheel is a gacha-like game that allows you to spin a wheel to get more rank points. 1 Kalodium will be
        used per spin. There are other prizes to be won there as well (merchandise, physical comic books, NFTs, whitelists and many more). 
        Prizes are tiered and access to these prizes increases with rarity of NFT parts (NFT cartridge system). No free spins. Unlimited number of spins per day as long as you have Kalodium to 
        burn. Most Kalodium (KALO) is produced thru synergy and you can get 1 Kalodium daily from logging in. The leaderboard scores take around 24 hours to 
        update so you may not see your points immediately.
<p> You will get 1 KALO per 5 rank points dropped to your account every Saturday. You can go to the profile page to see your pending synergy points and Kalodium. You can also use the calculator given above as it will compute
  it automatically for you. 
</p>

        <p>  On top of your weekly KALO allocation, you will be given 1 KALO per 5 rank point of your
           final monthly points. 

          Example: By the last day of synergy you have 500 KALO left in your wallet. 
          You were able to accumulate 10,000 rank points that month. You will be given 2000 KALO
           on top of your 500 KALO left in your wallet. By the end of the month you will have 2500 KALO
            to start the next month.</p>

      <h2> NFT charge (for future development)</h2>
      <p> Once a day, the website will choose one of the 54 NFT traits to be featured. If you have an NFT with that trait, you can 
        use it as a cartridge to boost your chances at getting legendary prizes. Clan parts provide the highest boost and will have significantly
        higher chances at getting legendary prizes, IF, clan parts are called upon by the Cartridge system.
