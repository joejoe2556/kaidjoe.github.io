      <h2> The Developers </h2>
      <img src="images/devs.jpg" alt="Developers">
      <p>It all started with Peggy Chung and Robert Simons. They hail from the Art Center College of Design,
         one of the best graphic design schools in the US. Robert continued his work in cinema with director Michael Bay on 
         <em>Transformers</em>. Peggy worked with Guillermo Del Toro on <em>Pacific Rim</em>. 
         They realized that there was a demand for top-tier designers in the field, so they established Gadget-Bot 
         Productions in 2011.</p>

      <p>Since then, they have been engaged in character concept art, environment concept art, 
        esports weapons concept art, 3D game assets (characters and weapons), film production and development, 
        game development, and animation production and development. They’ve worked on 
        big titles in the gaming industry, 
        including AAA games like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Borderlands</em>, as well as major movie
         titles. These professionals are not only experts in graphic design, but they are also skilled storytellers,
          which is why I’m personally bullish about this project.</p>
      
      <p>I believe they are the most qualified to create NFTs in this space precisely because they can easily
         craft experiences that people can enjoy. Access to experiences is what gives NFTs utility and value. 
         The team's ability to create immersive experiences is what will keep the economy alive and prevent people 
         from cashing out the token every time they extract it from the IP. Sustainability is achieved when people 
         stop exchanging your token for cash and start spending it on the IP to immerse themselves further. 
         The past few months have been amazing for me as a Sparksuit holder. 
         I was airdropped the second NFT—Spirit Guardian—for free. I have early access to everything related
          to <em>Kaidro</em>, including the game and the animated series. The team has been shipping non-stop.

           <p> This is their legacy—they’ve stamped their names on the IP. I genuinely believe their passion will drive them to new heights in this field, 
            and I'm fully supporting them every step of the way. </p>

      <h2> Developer testimony (Robert) </h2>
      <img src="images/game.png" alt="Game">
      <p> Robert: As we approach the release of the Kaidro Spark Suit Mint and Kaidro Clan Battles Alpha, I've been reflecting on the journey that has brought us here. 
        It's important to recognize the years of dedication poured into this project.</p>

      <p> Peggy Chung and I began shaping the core concept and lore in 2010,
         but it wasn't until 2019 that comic development began. Transitioning to platforms like Webtoons and witnessing the support on Kickstarter 
         for physical books was immensely fulfilling, yet our aspirations extended beyond comics.</p>
      
      <p>In 2021, we set our sights on developing a game, drawing from our experiences with projects like Apex, 
        Borderlands, and Call of Duty. With the support of fans and investors, 2022 saw the birth of Kaidro Clan Battles. However, 
        our vision didn't stop at Web 2.0. Peggy and I always had our eyes on Web 3.0,
         but we aimed to integrate it into the entire IP, not just the game. This endeavor led to a complete overhaul, including the creation of the NFT collection for Kaidro.</p>
      
      <p>In 2022, alongside the game development, we began crafting the Spark Suit Collection. 
        Our goal was to elevate the NFT ecosystem, not merely create a collection of profile pictures
        . This posed significant challenges, requiring us to build hundreds of parts for the suits, graphics, color sets, and more. W
        hat you see today are beautifully animated NFTs of Spark Suits, but beneath the surface lie their utilities.</p>
      
      <p>Utilizing Unreal Engine 5, we were able to seamlessly integrate these skins into the final collection, 
        the game, comics, and animations simultaneously. Fast forward to 2024, and we've already released our first free collection
         of journals with an incredible mint of over 340,000. But this is just the beginning.</p>
      
      <p>In the coming week, our two-year plan from 2022 will begin to unfold. Our dream is to make NFT avatar skins seamlessly
         transition throughout our entire intellectual property—an experience for collectors to own and utilize within the ecosystem.</p>
      
      <p>I'm thrilled for what lies ahead and extend my heartfelt gratitude to everyone who has supported us, especially those who 
        have been with us for years. There's something truly special on the horizon for you. Thank you!</p>
